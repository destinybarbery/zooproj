	<h1>Sloth</h1>
	<h3>Sloths are very lazy animals and can sleep up to 16 hours a day! Everything about them is slow, even their digestive systems are slow. Fun fact actually really sad fact sloths can die ona full stomach because of how slow their immune systems is. Because of their slow digestive system, they only poop once a week, how interesting right? There are two types of sloths, the two toed sloths are the most dangerous while three toed sloths are very patient and sweet. But it is not a good idea to get either upset. Come see our sloths, behind glass of course</h3>
