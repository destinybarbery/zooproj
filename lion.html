	<h1>Lion</h1>
	<h3>Lions are very protective animals who will literally die for their family. They love to live in groups, actually they are the only type of cats that want to live in a group. A group of lions is called a pride and these groups can have up to 30 lions. Imagine the family reunions! Show your pride and come see the lions today!</h3>
