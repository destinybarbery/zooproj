	<h1>Seal</h1>
	<h3>Although they may not look like it, seals are actually related to bears. Crazy right? Seals like all the other animals are very social and love being in groups. They even enjoy making new friends, having their "parties" have almost 1500 guests. But some seals prefer to be alone, the crowd is not their thing</h3>
